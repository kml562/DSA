### Q- What is recursion ? How does it work?

 - Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller versions of the same problem. It keeps calling itself until it reaches a stopping condition called the base case. By solving smaller versions of the problem, it eventually solves the original problem.

 ### How to solve a problem recursively?

### To solve a problem recursively, you can follow these steps:-

- Identify the base case: Determine the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly. This base case should not involve any further recursive calls.

- Define the recursive case: Break down the original problem into smaller subproblems that are similar in nature. Define how to solve these subproblems by calling the same function recursively.

- Invoke the recursive function: Call the function within itself, passing the smaller subproblems as arguments. Make sure the arguments are modified in a way that moves towards the base case.

- Combine the results: When the base case is reached, return the solution for that specific case. As the recursive calls return, combine their results to solve the larger instances of the problem.

- Ensure termination: Ensure that the recursive calls eventually reach the base case. Otherwise, the recursion may continue indefinitely, causing a stack overflow or infinite loop.

- By following these steps, you can apply recursion to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and solving them iteratively until the base case is reached.

### How to analyze the time and space complexity of a recursive algorithm?

- Analyzing the time and space complexity of a recursive algorithm involves assessing how the algorithm's execution time and memory usage grow with the input size. Here's how you can approach it:

1. Time Complexity Analysis:
   - Identify the number of recursive calls: Determine how many times the function is called recursively in terms of the input size or any other relevant parameter.
   - Determine the work done per recursive call: Evaluate the operations performed within each recursive call, excluding any recursive calls made.
   - Define the recurrence relation: Express the time complexity of the algorithm using a recurrence relation based on the number of recursive calls and the work done per call.
   - Solve the recurrence relation: Solve the recurrence relation to determine the overall time complexity of the algorithm. This can be done through various methods like substitution, recursion tree, or master theorem.

2. Space Complexity Analysis:
   - Identify the space required per recursive call: Evaluate the memory usage within each recursive call, including any local variables, function parameters, and additional space required for each call.
   - Determine the maximum recursion depth: Determine the maximum number of recursive calls that can be active simultaneously, which corresponds to the maximum recursion depth.
   - Define the recurrence relation: Express the space complexity of the algorithm using a recurrence relation based on the space required per call and the maximum recursion depth.
   - Solve the recurrence relation: Solve the recurrence relation to determine the overall space complexity of the algorithm. This can be done using similar techniques as in time complexity analysis.

It's important to note that recursive algorithms can sometimes be transformed into equivalent iterative algorithms, which may have different time and space complexities. Additionally, the choice of data structures and algorithm design can also impact the complexities.

By following these steps, you can analyze the time and space complexity of a recursive algorithm and gain insights into its efficiency and resource requirements.





### How can we apply recursion in a better way?

To apply recursion in a better way, consider the following guidelines:

1. Define the base case carefully: The base case determines when the recursion should stop. Ensure that it is well-defined and covers all possible scenarios. If the base case is not properly defined, it may lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results.

2. Ensure progress towards the base case: In each recursive call, the input should be modified in a way that moves closer to the base case. This ensures that the recursion progresses and eventually terminates. If the input remains the same or moves away from the base case, it may result in unnecessary recursive calls or incorrect results.

3. Avoid redundant computation: Recursive algorithms can sometimes perform redundant computations by solving the same subproblem multiple times. To improve efficiency, consider using techniques like memoization or dynamic programming to store and reuse the results of previously solved subproblems.

4. Analyze time and space complexity: Before implementing a recursive algorithm, analyze its time and space complexity to understand its efficiency and resource requirements. This helps in identifying potential performance issues and optimizing the algorithm if needed.

5. Consider iterative alternatives: In some cases, a recursive algorithm can be transformed into an equivalent iterative (loop-based) algorithm. Iterative solutions often have lower overhead and can be more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. Therefore, consider whether an iterative approach might be more appropriate for the problem at hand.

6. Understand the problem domain: Recursive solutions are particularly useful for problems with inherent recursive structures, such as tree traversal or backtracking. Understanding the problem domain and recognizing its recursive nature can help in designing more elegant and intuitive recursive algorithms.

By following these guidelines, you can apply recursion in a better way, leading to more efficient and effective solutions to recursive problems.
