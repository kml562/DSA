Explanation
The insert function takes two arguments: element, which represents the element to be inserted, and index, which
represents the index at which the element should be inserted. The function first checks if the index is valid. If
the index is great
Add reaction
than the size of the linked list or less than zero and the size of the linked list is not zero,
the function returns false.
Add reaction
Next, the function creates a new node with the given element and initializes two variables: current, which
represents the current node in the linked list, and prev, which represents the previous node in the linked list.
The function also initializes a coun

counter i to zero.

If the index is zero, the function inserts the new node at the beginning of the linked list by setting the next
property of the new node to the current head of the linked list and setting the head of the linked list to the new node.
Add reaction
If the index is not zero, the function enters a loop that continues until the i is equal to the index. In each
iteration of the loop, the function sets prev to current and current to the next node in the linked list. Once
Add reaction
the loop is finished, prev will be the node immediately before the index and current will be the node at the
index.
Add reaction
The function then inserts the new node at the index by setting the next property of prev to the new node,
setting prev to the new node, and setting the next property of the new node to current.

Finally, the function increments the size of the linked list.
