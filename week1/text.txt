AMY AND ARRAY
Problem Statement



Amy has an array A, of N integers. In one operation she can select any element of the array and decrease it by 1 such that the resultant number is non-negative.

She wants to make her array such that for each index K (1<=K<=N), following must hold for all the indices X (1<=X<K) less than it:

· Either AX = 0 or,

· AX < AK



Find the minimum number of operations required to make her array as she wants.



You are given T independent test cases.





Constraints

1 <= T <= 5
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= AK <= 109
All input values are integers.




Input Format

First-line contains T.
First line of each test case consists of a single integer N.
Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.




Output Format

Print in in a newline for each test case single integer denoting the minimum number of operations required to make her array as she wants.




Sample Input 1

2

5

1 1 9 17 19

2

1 2





Sample Output 1

1

0





Explanation of Sample 1



For 1st test case, she selects the first element and decrease it by 1. So array becomes [0,1,9,17, 19]







Things to Note for the Candidate:



 You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code.



The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution.



Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output.



Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. -Sample Problem Statement  (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)
