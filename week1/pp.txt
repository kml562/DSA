A&gt;=B
Problem Statement
Amy has an array A, of N integers. Initially all the elements of array are 0, i.e., Ai = 0 (1<=i<=N). She also has an array B of N integers.

In one operation she can chose an index K, (1<=K<=N) and increase each element of array A, by 1 except AK. (1-based indexing).

For example, N = 4, A = [0, 0, 0, 0], she can choose K = 2 and increase all the elements of array except A2. So, the array becomes A = [1, 0, 1,1]
Find minimum number of operations required for her to make each element of array A, greater than corresponding element in array B, i.e., for each i (1<=i<=N) make Ai>=Bi.
You are given T independent test cases.



Constraints



1 <= T <= 5


3 <= N <= 105


1 <= Bi < = 109


All input values are integers.




Input Format



First-line contains T.


First line of each test case consists of a single integer N.


Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array B.




Output Format



Print in a newline for each test case a single integer denoting the minimum number of operations required for her to make each element of array A, greater than corresponding element in array B, i.e., for each i (1<=i<=N) make Ai>=Bi.




Sample Input 1



1

3

2 1 1





Sample Output 1



2







Explanation of Sample 1



Initially A = [0, 0, 0]



In 1st operation, she choses K = 2, so A = [1, 0, 1]



In 2nd operation she choses K = 3, so A = [ 2, 1, 1]



Now for each i (1<=i<=3), Ai = Bi







Things to Note for the Candidate:



You can use your own IDE like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or any other IDE that you are comfortable with to build your solution code.


The IDE provided on the platform is purely for submission. Avoid using the IDE for coding out the solution.


Test against any custom input in your own IDE. In the IDE provided on the platform, you cannot pass custom test cases and see the output. 


Use standard input and standard output in your program for the IDE to run the test cases smoothly against your code. We are giving a sample problem statement along with a solution that will pass the test cases in the IDE. - Sample Problem Statement  (Right Click and Open in New Tab to view.)
