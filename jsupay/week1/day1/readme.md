## Fancy the Future
- Understand how someone envisions their future through the filter of silly questions. Keep in mind, while these questions may be humorous, a person’s answers can uncover what they are truly looking for in the upcoming years. 

What reality show would you appear on? Get a glimpse at which reality show best defines their personality. Does their future hold a lot of baking, or the chance to gossip with the neighbors?
If a movie was made of your life, what genre would it be and who would play you? This question will help you understand how a person interprets their own life, but as they describe it through a movie genre and actor.
If money did not exist and you could have any job in the world, what would you do? Realistically, the concept of money will always be around, but you can uncover a great deal about what someone is truly passionate about.
Would you like a world with magic in it? We highly encourage everyone to consider a world like Harry Potter (minus He Who Shall Not Be Named and Death Eaters, of course).
If you could live on Mars, what would you do? Discover what someone would do in a situation that is quite literally out-of-this-world. The future may hold this opportunity sooner, rather than later!
What would you do with your “15 minutes” of fame? There are so many possible ways to capitalize on a moment to shine when you have the attention of the world. Find out if the person would seek fame and what they would do, or if they would shun the limelight entirely.
If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go? A romantic getaway to Paris, an exciting trip to Las Vegas, or a relaxing vacation to Cancun can be indicators of various personality traits and help you learn what means most to them.
What celebrity do you wish you would run into walking around town? Learn who someone idolizes and wishes they could meet outside of their television. Go further and ask them what their first question would be for the celebrity and whether they would ask for a selfie.
What business pitch would you make if you were on Shark Tank? There have been some crazy ideas presented on this TV show, so no pitch is out-of-bounds. Robot Drive Suits and Wired Waffles are a few of our favorites that didn’t quite bait the sharks.
If you could pass one talent on to your children, what would it be? Find out if a person has a secret talent that may be in store for future generations
